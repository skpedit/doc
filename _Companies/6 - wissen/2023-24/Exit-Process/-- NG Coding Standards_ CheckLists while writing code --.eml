.use of PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case, SNAKE_CASE naming conventions
.Keep services focused on a single responsibility.
.Suffix names with "****.service.ts", "****.page.ts", "****.component.ts",
"****.mock.ts", .....
.Use project prefix for component selectors like <wissen-modal-dialog/>
.dependency injection system to inject services where needed
.use onPushStrategy/ use this.cdr if required
.Use encapsulation strategies (ViewEncapsulation) wisely based on component
requirements
.Unsubscribe from observables to avoid memory leaks
.Use operators like switchMap and mergeMap to avoid nested subscriptions
.Write self-explanatory code, proper name for members/methods(verbs), use
CONST_DATA, readonly, private, public for members in component
.reduce the if else conditions(use ternary, ??, :?, ?., ..., &&, |, & in
oneline for data manipulation)
.Write unit tests for components, services, directive and other Angular
constructs, Snapshot Test for ngRx Store(Marble Test for Observables)
.Keep templates clean by avoiding complex logic. Move logic to the
component class
.Avoid using the : any type unless absolutely necessary. Provide explicit
type definitions for variables, parameters, and return types
.for each unit Module keep the folders:
container/componet/service/model/mock/constant/directive/
.use new Map() for structure the complex data, handle switch case in new
Map() to select the key value
.use <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet/> for switch case/nested condition in
component html
.Document important aspects of the code(logic)
.Place each component in its own file
.not to use ::ng-deep in scss for styling the elements, instead use :host,
:host-context()
.$npm audit for checking the js vunerability in packages
.do $npm run verify  which should verify the eslint and test spec and
prettify
.add teams notification in git workflow

.keep the imports order angular package to install
.remove un-necessary methods if not used like constructor() {} inside
component
.variables/returns should have meaning to understand the purpose
